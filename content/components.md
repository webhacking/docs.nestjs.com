### Providers

Basically, almost everything may be considered as a provider â€“ service, repository, factory, helper, and so on. All of them can **inject** dependencies, meaning, they can create various relationships with each other. But in fact, a provider is nothing else than just a simple class annotated with an `@Injectable()` decorator.

In the previous chapter, we have built a simple `CatsController`. Controllers shall handle HTTP requests and delegate more complex tasks to the **providers**. The providers are plain JavaScript classes with an `@Injectable()` decorator on top of them.

> info **Hint** Since Nest enables the possibility to design and organize the dependencies in a more OO-way, we strongly recommend following the **SOLID** principles.

#### Services

Let's start by creating a simple `CatsService` provider.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.service)
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Cat } from './interfaces/cat.interface';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  private readonly cats: Cat[] = [];

  create(cat: Cat) {
    this.cats.push(cat);
  }

  findAll(): Cat[] {
    return this.cats;
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  constructor() {
    this.cats = [];
  }

  create(cat) {
    this.cats.push(cat);
  }

  findAll() {
    return this.cats;
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** To create a service using CLI, simply execute `$ nest g service cats` command.

Here's a `CatsService`, a basic class with one property and two methods. The only new trait is that it uses the `@Injectable()` decorator. The `@Injectable()` attaches the metadata, thereby Nest knows that this class is a Nest provider. Notice that there is a `Cat` interface used above which could potentially look like this:

```typescript
export interface Cat {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  breed: string;
}
```

Since we have the service class already done, let's use it inside the `CatsController`:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
import { Controller, Get, Post, Body } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CreateCatDto } from './dto/create-cat.dto';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';
import { Cat } from './interfaces/cat.interface';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  constructor(private readonly catsService: CatsService) {}

  @Post()
  async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
    this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
  }

  @Get()
  async findAll(): Promise<Cat[]> {
    return this.catsService.findAll();
  }
}
@@switch
import { Controller, Get, Post, Body, Bind, Dependencies } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';

@Controller('cats')
@Dependencies(CatsService)
export class CatsController {
  constructor(catsService) {
    this.catsService = catsService;
  }

  @Post()
  @Bind(Body())
  async create(createCatDto) {
    this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
  }

  @Get()
  async findAll() {
    return this.catsService.findAll();
  }
}
```

The `CatsService` is injected through the class constructor. Don't be afraid of the `private readonly` shortened syntax. It means that we've created and initialized the `catsService` member immediately in the same location.

#### Dependency injection

Nest is built around the strong design pattern commonly known as **Dependency injection**. We recommend to read a great article about this concept in the official [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection) documentation.

In Nest, thanks to the TypeScript capabilities, it's extremely easy to manage dependencies because they will be resolved just by type and afterward, passed to your controller's constructor (or assigned to the indicated property):

```typescript
constructor(private readonly catsService: CatsService) {}
```

#### Scopes

Each provider has a lifetime strictly dependent on the application lifecycle. Once the application is bootstrapped, every given provider has to be instantiated. Similarly, when the application shutdown, each provider will be destroyed. However, there are ways to make your provider lifetime request-scoped as well. You can read more about these techniques [here](/fundamentals/scopes).

#### Custom providers

An inversion of control container, that Nest makes use of to resolve relationships between providers, is far more powerful than described above. The `@Injectable()` decorator is only a tip of an iceberg, not strictly required to define providers. Instead, you can use plain values, classes, either asynchronous or synchronous factories. Look [here](/fundamentals/dependency-injection) to find more examples.

#### Optional providers

Occasionally, you might face relations which do not necessarily have to be resolved. For instance, your class may depend on a **configuration object**, but if none was passed, the default values should be used. In such case, the relation becomes optional, because lack of the configuration provider wouldn't lead to errors.

To ensure that provider isn't required, use `@Optional()` decorator in the `constructor` signature.

```typescript
import { Injectable, Optional, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class HttpService<T> {
  constructor(
    @Optional() @Inject('HTTP_OPTIONS') private readonly httpClient: T,
  ) {}
}
```

#### Property-based injection

In some very specific cases, a property-based injection might be useful. For instance, if your top-level class depends on either one or multiple providers, passing them all the way up by calling `super()` in sub-classes from the constructor can be very annoying. Thus, in order to avoid it, you can use `@Inject()` decorator on a property level.

```typescript
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class HttpService<T> {
  @Inject('HTTP_OPTIONS')
  private readonly httpClient: T;
}
```

> warning **Warning** If your class doesn't extend any other provider, you should always prefer using **constructor-based** injection.

#### Provider registration

The last thing is to tell the module that something called `CatsService` truly exists. We do this by editing our module file - `app.module.ts`, and putting the service into the `providers` array of the `@Module()` decorator.

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsController } from './cats/cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats/cats.service';

@Module({
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [CatsService],
})
export class ApplicationModule {}
```

Hence, Nest will be able to resolve the dependencies of the `CatsController` class. This is how our directory structure looks right now:

<div class="file-tree">
<div class="item">src</div>
<div class="children">
<div class="item">cats</div>
<div class="children">
<div class="item">dto</div>
<div class="children">
<div class="item">create-cat.dto.ts</div>
</div>
<div class="item">interfaces</div>
<div class="children">
<div class="item">cat.interface.ts</div>
</div>
<div class="item">cats.service.ts</div>
<div class="item">cats.controller.ts</div>
